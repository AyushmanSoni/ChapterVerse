## Challenges and Solutions

During the development of this project, I encountered several key challenges that provided valuable learning opportunities. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

### 1. Managing Asynchronous Operations-

**Challenge**: Ensuring the database connection is established before the server starts handling requests.

**Solution**: Implemented `async/await` to handle the asynchronous nature of `mongoose.connect()`, ensuring a stable connection before server startup.

### 2. Environment Configuration

**Challenge**: Correctly configuring and using environment variables.

**Solution**: Utilized the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file, ensuring essential variables like the database URI and port number were properly configured.

### 3. Error Handling

**Challenge**: Implementing robust error handling for database connections and server startup.

**Solution**: Added `try-catch` blocks around asynchronous operations to log meaningful error messages and potentially recover from errors.

### 4. Code Modularity

**Challenge**: Designing the application with modular and reusable components.

**Solution**: Exported the database connection function from a separate module, promoting a modular design and better separation of concerns.

By addressing these challenges, I was able to enhance the reliability, maintainability, and overall quality of the application.
